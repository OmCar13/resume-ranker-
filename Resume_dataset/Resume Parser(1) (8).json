It contains two phases for data management and dashboard design. In \nthe first phase we had to process the historical data of 3yrs and make different transformations on \nit as requested by client. Then in second phase we had to design the Tableau dashboard on the \nprocessed data. There was also some basic regression model build in SAS based on the processed \ndata. \nThe goal of the project was to provide a visualization on the number of how many days the clients \ntake to pay a given invoice past the allocated transaction due date. \n \nRoles & Responsibilities: \n\n Met with the clients to define business requirements relating to dashboard needs.  \n\n Worked closely with the client to define various transformations to be done on source data. \n\n Assisted with the design of processes and requirements for dashboard. \n\n Written SAS code to process the data and designed dashboard. \n\n Testing the visualization for data accuracy and consistency. \n\n Run, view and analyze the reports in different formats. \n \n\nProject 2: Economic Retail Factor Impact Analysis \n \n\n My major responsibility was to assist the modelling team in creating a complex Tableau \ndashboard to demonstrate the modelling features for the macro economic data. \n\n Created complex codes in Tableau for various visualization including data for 11 countries and \nmore than 20 macro-economic data drivers. \n\n Assisted meddling team in writing codes in Python for an Arimax model on Macro economic \nfactors like GDP, Consumer Confidence Index, House hold savings, real disposable incomes, \nUnemployment rate to forecast the growth rate for retail sector in eleven countries, using \nOxford economics data. \n\n Model validations, outlier detections, data preparation for Tableau etc. \n \n\nEnvironment: Python, Regression modelling, Tableau based complex dashboard \n \n\nProject 3: Retail Store Network \n \n\nProject in brief: The Objective of this model was to recognize and define network of stores in the \ngiven territory and thereby understanding cross-shopping behaviour of customers across various \nstore formats. \nSteps Taken: \n\n Identified the cross shopping of the customer between two stores to solve the out of stock \ncondition  \n\n Then developed a distance matrix of all stores using % of cross shopping as a parameter to \ndecide closeness between stores \n\n Created Clusters based on distance matrix ,calculate various other attributes like weekly spend, \nbasket size, % of unique customers at store level and analyse them on each cluster \n\n\n\n \n\nProject 4: Demand Analysis- Cluster Model \n \n\n For a US based client identified the location for new service plants to be opened basis the demand \ndata available with Latitude and Longitude. \n\n Targeted to meet 80% demand in 2 transit day. \n\n Generated demand centric clusters using K- Mean cluster in Python  \n \nEnvironment: Python, Tableau \n \n\nCertifications and AWARDS \n\n Achieved Certificate in Analytics for Business Intelligence from Amity Global Business School, \nSingapore. \n\nPersonal Information \n \n\nFather’ Name               : Mr. Vijay Singh Chauhan  \nDate of birth   : 03rd Nov 1996 \nPassport                                : P8965321 \nStatus    : Single \nLanguages known  : English and Hindi","annotation":[{"label":["Total experience"],"points":[{"start":3785,"end":3845,"text":"Python, Regression modelling, Tableau based complex dashboard"}]},{"label":["Skills"],"points":[{"start":2847,"end":2849,"text":"SAS"}]},{"label":["Skills"],"points":[{"start":2346,"end":2348,"text":"SAS"}]},{"label":["Email"],"points":[{"start":1907,"end":1927,"text":"Vishal19304@gmail.com"}]},{"label":["Phone"],"points":[{"start":1887,"end":1896,"text":"9999387099"}]},{"label":["Name"],"points":[{"start":1834,"end":1840,"text":"CHAUHAN"}]},{"label":["Name"],"points":[{"start":1820,"end":1831,"text":"VISHAL SINGH"}]},{"label":["Skills"],"points":[{"start":1789,"end":1800,"text":"Tableau 2019"}]},{"label":["Skills"],"points":[{"start":1732,"end":1738,"text":"Alteryx"}]},{"label":["Skills"],"points":[{"start":1728,"end":1730,"text":"SQL"}]},{"label":["Skills"],"points":[{"start":1724,"end":1726,"text":"SAS"}]},{"label":["Skills"],"points":[{"start":1713,"end":1722,"text":"Python 3.6"}]},{"label":["10 %"],"points":[{"start":1587,"end":1631,"text":"Xth – CBSE MVN, Faridabad 2010 9.8(Out of 10)"}]},{"label":["12 %"],"points":[{"start":1545,"end":1583,"text":"XIIth   -

The security for all the applications can be managed \nfrom this one central site. Once any application gets configured with Alcatraz Security Manager, the roles, \nprivileges and users can be customized as per the application's requirement. Based on this security mapping, \nthe behavior gets changed for the particular logged user. Once the standard user sends the access request for \na particular application, the user and admin will get the email notification and the request moves to the admin \ndashboard. Then any admin user can approve/reject the access request and the same email notification will \nbe received back by both user and admin.

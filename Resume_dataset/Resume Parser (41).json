Project Description\n\nTitle: GCO ODS Remediation\nClient: World's leading biotechnology Organisation\n\nOverview:It is one of the world’s leading biotechnology companies also is a values-based company, deeply rooted in science and innovation to transform new ideas and discoveries into medicines for patients with serious illnesses. \n              Previously there was CMA database which contains Customer Master & Alignment data which     \n              was used by downstream system and different ETLAPPS vendors but as per current project     \n requirement, the CMA data was divided into Customer Master (CM) and Alignment Master (AM)     \n              but Alignment data will be loaded by DIH data source which was propagated to the \n              ETL_APP vendors in the form of flat files.\n\nThe major Development task undertaken by me for this Enhancement involved developing SQL        Scripts, introducing several mapping to maintain and validate the functionality of the workflows. Other contributions were developing the Shell Scripts to Copy the file from Cloud path to Share point path, Uploading the path from share point location to MOVEIT.\n\n             Responsibilities\n· Requirement Analysis.\n· Designing the solution, coordinating with onshore team member during the entire lifecycle of the release.\n· Development of Informatica mapping catering to specific business requirements using Informatica 9.1.0 Power center.\n· Unit testing and System testing and incorporation of any changes required in the developed application.\n· Providing different vendors their corresponding sample test output files as per their requirement with new set of DIH data.\n· Code migration to Production server.\n· Analyze and Fix the bugs reported by business.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Project Description\n\nTitle: Next Gen Customer Master Remediation\nClient: World’s leading biotechnology Organisation\n\n\nOverview: The Source for Customer and Alignment data which use to flow into ODS was CMA but as per the business requirement CMA will no longer be sending the Customer data into ODS but would be replaced by another source MDM. The Customer Data is used by downstream system and different ETLAPPS vendors. Customer data was remediated and loaded by DIH which was propagated to the ETL_APP vendors in the form of flat files.\n\nThe major Development task undertaken by me for this Enhancement involved developing SQL         Scripts, introducing several mapping to maintain and validate the functionality of the workflows. Other contributions were developing the Shell Scripts to Copy the file from Cloud path to Share point path, Uploading the path from share point location to MOVEIT.\n\nResponsibilities\n· Requirement Analysis.\n· Designing the solution, coordinating with onshore team member during the entire lifecycle of the release.\n· Development of Informatica mapping catering to specific business requirements using Informatica 9.1.0 Power center.\n· Unit testing and System testing and incorporation of any changes required in the developed application.\n· Providing different vendors their corresponding sample test output files as per their requirement with new set of DIH data.\n· Code migration to Production server.\n· Analyze and Fix the bugs reported by business.\n\n\n3. Project Description\n\nTitle: ETL Performance Tuning\nClient: World's leading biotechnology organisation\n\n\nOverview: There were number of ETL’s which took around 10-12 hours in completing due to which number of user’s experienced missing data in oracle table. Post completion of Tuning, the ETL running time reduced from 10-12 hours to 7-10 minutes resulting in user able to access the data within the Allocated time.\n\nThe Major Development task undertaken by me for this project was to identify the bottleneck in the ETL process leading to delay. Bottleneck Identified in the ETL sub process and provided the resolution. The serial processing which use to take place resulting in delay was changed to parallel processing resulting in only one iteration.\n\nResponsibilities:\n\n· Requirement Analysis.\n· Designing the solution, coordinating with onshore team member during the entire lifecycle of the release.\n· Development of Informatica mapping catering to performance tuning in Informatica 9.6.2 Power center.\n· Unit testing and System testing and incorporation of any changes required in the developed application.\n· Provided user the data within the required SLA.\n· Checked the Data Quality in order to provide customer a valid Data.\n· Code migration to Production server.\n· Analyze and Fix the bugs reported by business.\n\n\n4. Project Description \nTitle:  SFDC Integration\nClient: World's leading biotechnology Organisation\n\nOverview: The source system will stop sharing the data through Teradata. Going forward the data will be fetched into the Compass Application using a file placed in S3 location. The file placed in S3 browser will be provided on weekly basis and need to place the file in share point location using Unix Shell Script.\n\nThe Major Development task undertaken by me for this project was to gather the requirement from the client, file placed in S3 browser to be placed in share point location using Unix shell script Developing Mapping, session as per the business requirement.\n\nResponsibilities:\n\n· Requirement Analysis.\n· Designing the solution, coordinating with onshore team member during the entire lifecycle of the release.\n· Development of Informatica mapping catering to business requirement in Informatica 9.6.2 Power center.\n· Unit testing and System testing and incorporation of any changes required in the developed application.\n· Checked the Data Quality in order to provide customer a valid Data.\n· Code migration to Production server.\n· Analyze and Fix the bugs reported by business.\n\n\n Achievements\n\n· Received client appreciation for coordination and defect free deliverables on time.\n· Received managers and senior manager’s appreciation for the error free deliverables and dedication.\n· Have a high level of personal commitment to each task, a can do attitude and a drive to deliver.\n· Have enough domain knowledge in Life Science.\n Personal Information\n\nContact Number\t: +91 9831269483\nEmail \t\t\t: adarshmsr1@gmail.com\nDate of Birth\t\t: 19th November 1993\nLinguistic Ability \t: English, Hindi \nCurrent Location \t: Kolkata\nAvailable to Relocate\t: Yes","annotation":null,"extras":null,"metadata":{"first_done_at":1625725229000,"last_updated_at":1625725229000,"sec_taken":0,"last_updated_by":"vikash.kumar@polestarllp.com","status":"done","evaluation":"NONE"}}

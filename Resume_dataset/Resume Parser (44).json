It revolutionizes access to revenue cycle information that was once thought difficult, or even impossible, to obtain.  Anodyne Health’s end-to-end solutions are delivered through a low-risk, Software-as-a-Service business model, where the data extraction, hosting, training, support, security, and disaster recovery are all managed by Anodyne Health.\nCybage assisted Anodyne with monthly Data Operations activity. Here, we got the entire monthly/weekly/daily data captured by Healthcare providers in the form of Extracts (.txt/.csv Files), doing integrity checks for them (i.e. correct no of files, correct no. of columns in those files etc.), running the SSIS packages/Stored procedures for extraction, cleansing and loading of data (ETL – Extraction, Transformation and Loading) onto the Presentation server. This ensured the monthly data refresh on Anodyne Analytics (Windows based application) & Dashboard (Web based application) used by the healthcare providers/clients. It assisted them with the Revenue cycle management and aided them in making decisions based on the various analysis metrics present in those applications.\n\nBrief outline of Data Operations work:  \n\nThe Operations team managed the monthly Production Cycle which involves processing of raw data for various clients belonging to numerous billing systems, using SQL/SSIS ETL technology\n\nResponsibility\n· Checking the raw files for data consistency and verifying that a particular dataset is not already processed.\n\n· Running the concerned SSIS Packages/Stored Procedures to extract/transform/load data into the respective databases.\n\n· Rectifying the issues with the Process runs.\n\n· Validating the processed data against Report Files received from clients. \n\n· Updating the State Side team on calls with the daily progress on the Production Cycle.\nProject #1:\nMSCOM_DA\n\nClient \n\nDuration\n\nMicrosoft\n\nSeptember 2011 –March 2012\nEnvironment\n\nSSIS  ETL technology, Excel Services, SQl server 2008\n\nSQL Server 2005, 2008R2.\n\nDescription\n\nMicrosoft India’s website http://microsoft.com/india is used for business purpose of operations in INDIA.

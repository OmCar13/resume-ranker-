{"content": "Machine Learning\n\nMachine Learning is the field of study that gives computer the capability to learn without being explicitly programmed.

Supervised Learning : Here we specify training data along with the target(dependent variable/value to predict) into the machine \nRegression and classifications comes under supervised learning\n\n                            \n (\nTraining data\n)\n (\nFinal Model\n) (\nMachine\n(Supervised Learning algorithm)\n) Ttttbnbnmbmnv  \n                                                                                                      \n                                                                                                               \n (\nTarget Variable\n)\n                                                     \n\n\n\nRegression: When the target variable/dependent variable is continuous value it is a regression problem.\nFor example:  predicting stock value, amount of rain happen next day, predicting profit and so on\nRegression algorithms:\n· Simple linear regression \n· Multiple linear regression\n· Polynomial regression\n· Decision Trees\n· Random forest\n· Support vector regressor\n\nClassification: When the target variable is a categorical value it is a classification problem. For example: whether stock will rise or fall, whether it will rain or not etc.\n\n\nClassification algorithms:\n· Logistic regression\n· K Nearest Neighbors’(KNN)\n· Decision Trees\n· Random forest\n· Naïve Bayes\n· Support vector classifier\n\n\n2.

Linear relationship\n2. Multivariate normality\n3. No or little multicollinearity \n4.

Further that it is regression or classification problem)\n2. Data collection\n3. Visualization of data to have a basic understanding of our data\n4. Train the algorithm\n5. Test the algorithm\n6. Compare test results to the actual results and collect feedback\n7. Refine the algorithm by tuning the parameters\n8. Perform steps 4-7 until the results are satisfactory \n9. Use the model to make predictions\nMachine learning can be grouped into two broad learning tasks:\n1. Supervised Learning : Here we specify training data along with the target(dependent variable/value to predict) into the machine \nRegression and classifications comes under supervised learning\n\n                            \n (\nTraining data\n)\n (\nFinal Model\n) (\nMachine\n(Supervised Learning algorithm)\n) Ttttbnbnmbmnv  \n                                                                                                      \n                                                                                                               \n (\nTarget Variable\n)\n                                                     \n\n\n\nRegression: When the target variable/dependent variable is continuous value it is a regression problem.\nFor example:  predicting stock value, amount of rain happen next day, predicting profit and so on\nRegression algorithms:\n· Simple linear regression \n· Multiple linear regression\n· Polynomial regression\n· Decision Trees\n· Random forest\n· Support vector regressor\n\nClassification: When the target variable is a categorical value it is a classification problem. For example: whether stock will rise or fall, whether it will rain or not etc.\n\n\nClassification algorithms:\n· Logistic regression\n· K Nearest Neighbors’(KNN)\n· Decision Trees\n· Random forest\n· Naïve Bayes\n· Support vector classifier\n\n\n2. Unsupervised learning: Here we just provide the training data and not the target variable. Machine itself learns the data and predict the categories on its own. \nClustering, recommender systems comes under unsupervised learning.\n (\nFinal model\n) (\nUnsupervised machine learning models\n) (\nTraining data\n)\n                                                                                                                                \n\n\n\nClustering: put data into some groups called clusters such that each cluster contains data with similar characteristics (as determined by the model, not in advance by humans)\nClustering example : Customer segmentation based on their age and salary\n\nClustering algorithms: \n· K-means clustering\n· Hierarchical clustering \n\nSimple Linear regression: statistical measure to analyze bivariate linear relationship.\nEquation:\n\tY = MX + C\nY: dependent or target variable to be predicted by the model\nM: slope of the line\nX: Independent variable\nC: constant (point where the line cuts the y-axis)\n\n\nLinear regression assumptions:\nFollowing assumptions must be fulfilled before applying linear regression model –\n1. Linear relationship\n2. Multivariate normality\n3. No or little multicollinearity \n4. No auto-correlation\nHow models works:\nLinear regression model tries to fit a linear line in the given data points until it finds a best fitted line.\nA best fitted line is that line which has minimum OLS (ordinary least square value) among all the lines\n\n\nGraph plotted for Experience(X) vs Salary(Y)\nAlgorithm:\n# import libraries\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom pandas import Series,DataFrame\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# loading data\ndata=pd.read_csv('Salary_Data.csv')\n# data preprocessing\ndata.isnull().any()\ndata.columns\nx=data[['YearsExperience']]\ny=data.iloc[:,1]\n\n#splitting data into training and test data\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nx_train,x_test,y_train,y_test=train_test_split(x,y,test_size=0.3,random_state=0)\n\n# creating linear regressor model\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\nregressor=LinearRegression()\nregressor.fit(x_train,y_train)\n\n# predicting the results\npredict=regressor.predict(x_test)\n\n# visualizing results \nplt.scatter(x_train,y_train,color='red')\nplt.plot(x_train,regressor.predict(x_train),color='blue')\nplt.title(\"Years of Experiences vs Total Salary\")\nplt.xlabel('Experience in years')\nplt.ylabel('Total Salary')\nplt.show()\n\nplt.scatter(x_test,y_test,color='red')\nplt.plot(x_train,regressor.predict(x_train),color='blue')\nplt.title(\"Years of Experiences vs Total Salary\")\nplt.xlabel('Experience in years')\nplt.ylabel('Total Salary')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\nSalary\t1.1000000000000001\t1.3\t1.5\t2\t2.2000000000000002\t2.9\t3\t3.2\t3.2\t3.7\t3.9\t4\t4\t4.0999999999999996\t4.5\t4.9000000000000004\t5.0999999999999996\t5.3\t5.9\t6\t6.8\t7.1\t7.9\t8.2000000000000011\t8.7000000000000011\t9\t9.5\t9.6\t10.3\t10.5\t39343\t46205\t37731\t43525\t39891\t56642\t60150\t54445\t64445\t57189\t63218\t55794\t56957\t57081\t61111\t67938\t66029\t83088\t81363\t93940\t91738\t98273\t101302\t113812\t109431\t105582\t116969\t112635\t122391\t121872","annotation":null,"extras":null,"metadata":{"first_done_at":1625031960000,"last_updated_at":1625031960000,"sec_taken":0,"last_updated_by":"vikash.kumar@polestarllp.com","status":"done","evaluation":"NONE"}}

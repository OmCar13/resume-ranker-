When the customer buys this service contract the amount on this contract is paid in installments by the customer. For every installment an invoice is generated. Billing files are sent to the dealers and a report is sent to the bank.\n\nThe customer can do the payment by different modes, like through cheques, credit cards and through Electronic fund transfer (EFT). In this process the deduction of the amount can be done on monthly basis automatically from the customer’s account. There are different websites for dealers and customers, the customer can do the payment online by this website.\nFleet Central Billing System (FCB) In FCB the cars get repair at the service centers anywhere in USA and Canada. The customers have different contracts based on which the service is provided by the Dealers for different fleets. The repairs are loaded into the FCB system through OWS repair load process. The repairs are bifurcated into repair as a service of vehicle or parts repair. The repairs have certain validations, if passed then it’s a valid repair else goes into invalid repair. The users also have an option to REFUSE certain repairs which will cause them to never be invoiced.  \n\nAfter the repairs are loaded invoices are generated only for valid repairs. Then the statements are generated for the invoices for the fleets and the payments are loaded into the FCB system.\n\nFCB will receive notification of a billing dispute from a fleet via call, letter, or fax against an invoiced repair. Once verified, invalid repairs are placed in dispute status and a credit is created. \n\nROLES & RESPONSIBILITIES\n· Development and modifications in the process by understanding and collecting business requirements from the client.\n\n· Collaborate with programmers, and designers for the development of database/software programs and applications.\n· Creating PL/SQL Packages, Procedures, Functions, Triggers, Views, joins and manipulating complex data sets in Oracle. \n· Manage database changes related to schema, procedures, views, functions, triggers.\n· Use SQL*Loader for data migration/conversation. \n· Migrated data from flat files to tables using SQL*Loader in Oracle.\n· Responsible for query optimization in the project. \n· Support all day to day activities related to database like data generation and perform VIN load using SQL*Loader data migration scripting and routines to automate day-to-day administrative tasks. \n· Perform monthly activities like NFPP part pricing monthly data load.\n· Create and maintain documentation, impact analysis and user manuals.\n· Perform meeting with our US/Canada clients, interacting with them and solving their problems.\n· Communicating with the clients through mails/calls and resolving the errors/problems that they face in the application and supporting them by providing the resolution for the issue.\nProject #2:\n\n\tProject Title\n\tNEWSCLIPS \n\n\tClient \n\tLEAR CORPORATION\n\n\tRole\n\tBA\n\n\tDuration \n\n\n\tFeb 2018 – Aug 2018\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION\nNewsClips application is designed to generate Newsletter on daily basis for LEAR Corporation.

This research paper is elaborated on various innovative Human Resource Practices in the banks of Ludhiana city for ideal working. This is exploratory type of research which explores about various HR Practices in general banking industries. The existing business environment requires banks as well as their HR teams to think creatively and come up with the new approaches to survive the downturn and bind the employees together. Innovative approaches would motivate the employees in different sectors especially the Indian Banking Sector to utilize their set of skills and knowledge through discretionary effort realizing Bank's business strategy. This approach to HRM is likely to contribute to improved economic performance of the banks as a whole. This paper tries to focus on whether the introduction of innovative HR practices leads to favourable or unfavourable outcomes among the employees in the Banking sector. The HR practices in banking sector of Ludhiana such as employee sourcing and human resource development initiatives are remarkably different from the manufacturing and other service sector companies.

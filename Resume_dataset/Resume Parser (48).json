Principal functionality of a TR is its record keeping of definitive copies of trade \n\ndata. CCIL launched CCP clearing of Rupee denominated IRS and FRA in March 2014. All \n\ntrades referenced to the MIBOR and MIOIS with original maturities ranging from 1 month to 10 \n\nyears are eligible for guaranteed settlement. Trades are reported in a prescribed format through \n\nthe Deal Reporting Utility. The trades are validated and matched. CCIL arrives at the net \n\nsettlement obligation arising out of cash flows due on the trades of members accepted for \n\nguaranteed settled through multi-lateral netting. The net settlement obligation is settled through \n\nthe member’s current accounts with RBI. \n\nSkills Used: PL/SQL, VB.net \n\nSub Projects: \n\n Deal message form CORE platform to CSS \nI have to create package and procedure that will perform some business validation and \n\ntechnical validation based on the business requirements and store the data in our \n\nmultiple base tables. After successful processing of the messages trades will be formed \n\nat CSS end and this trade information we have to send different system. \n\n \n\nSkills Used: PL/SQL \n\n \n\n Unwind Process in CSS  \nIn this development a third member was taking place between two members in which \n\nif one member don’t want to continue that particular trade so he will put Reversal and \n\nthe third member will take place , all the obligation of that member will be settled on \n\nnext day during settlement of members. This unwind process will happen again and \n\nagain if any member will put reversal between party and counterparty. Function, \n\nprocedure, package, records and index are used in this development. \n\n \n\nSkills Used – PL/SQL and SQL.  \n\n \n\n Deal Query in Trade Repository System \nIn this development I have to provide all the details related to a member like payment \n\ndetails, transaction details, settlement details, Trade Date. For this I had created \n\npackage, procedures, joins of tables and windows form application in VB.Net. I got \n\nappreciation from Clients.  \n\nSkills Used - SQL, PL/SQL and VB.NET. \n\n \n\n Crystal Report Migration \nFor generating PDF member reports, internal reports and RBI reports we are using \n\ncrystal reports tool. Earlier we were using CR 2010 version but due to performance \n\nissue we migrated to Crystal reports 2013. \n\n \n\nSkills- SQL and SAP Crystal Reports 2013 \n\n \n\n Swap rate Computation for Rate Entry Process \nBefore this development rate was directly entered by user through rate entry screen but \n\ndue to some business requirement now rate will be computed first based on some \n\ncriteria like tenor and benchmark, so rate entry will be happen using this screen which \n\nwas developed in VB.Net. In this development we created some packages and \n\nprocedures for rate computation. \n\n \n\nSkills Used- PL/SQL and VB.Net \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nResponsibilities \n\n  Interacted with clients to gather the requirement and implement the same in the project.  \n\n  Understand the business requirement specification.  \n\n  Implement PL/SQL and SQL queries as per the design and development related    \n\nrequirements.  \n\n  Involved in resolving potential bottlenecks via optimized solutions in Production issues.  \n\n  Quality assurance and application performance testing at unit, system and UAT phases.  \n\n  Create Documentation of design & requirements.

A Trade Repository or Swap Data Repository is an entity that centrally collects and maintains the records of over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives. Principal functionality of a TR is its record keeping of definitive copies of trade data. CCIL launched CCP clearing of Rupee denominated IRS and FRA in March 2014. All trades referenced to the MIBOR and MIOIS with original maturities ranging from 1 month to 10 years are eligible for guaranteed settlement. Trades are reported in a prescribed format through the Deal Reporting Utility. The trades are validated and matched. CCIL arrives at the net settlement obligation arising out of cash flows due on the trades of members accepted for guaranteed settled through multi-lateral netting. The net settlement obligation is settled through the member’s current accounts with RBI.\nSkills Used: PL/SQL, VB.net\nSub Projects:\n· Deal message form CORE platform to CSS\nI have to create package and procedure that will perform some business validation and technical validation based on the business requirements and store the data in our multiple base tables.

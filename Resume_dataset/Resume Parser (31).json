The tool can be compared \nwith a tool that may help an HR for recruitment. But the scenario in the logistics industry is very different and \ntherefore we had to come up with this tool. Tech used: LAMP Stack. \n\nACHIEVEMENTS \n\nArtifacia Hackathon Winner ​— ​Winner at Artifacia AI Hackathon - 2017. \nDeveloped Travel Recommendation Engine which would allow users to find travel places of similar interest. \nWith the use of AI, Users can upload pictures of their destinations and the engine would parse those images and \nrecommend similar places with the help of Artificial Intelligence. \n\nSwiss Re Bluemix Hackathon 3rd prize ​— ​II​nd​ Runner Up at SwissRe Bluemix Hackathon - \n2016. \nDeveloped a relocation tool which would allow users to take into account various factors before moving into a \nparticular city. Users can see the crime rate, education rate, health-risk rate, etc of a particular place in the \nform of heat maps. Thus allowing users to relocate in a good neighborhood. \n\nPragyan Hackathon 2015 Award ​— ​Won the prize for most Slick UI at Pragyan Hackathon - \n2015. \nCouldn’t win the hackathon but got awarded for the most beautiful and slick UI among all entries. \n\n ","annotation":[{"label":["Total experience"],"points":[{"start":5176,"end":5261,"text":"Swiss Re Bluemix Hackathon 3rd prize ​— ​II​nd​ Runner Up at SwissRe Bluemix Hackathon"}]},{"label":["Total experience"],"points":[{"start":4887,"end":4990,"text":"Developed Travel Recommendation Engine which would allow users to find travel places of similar interest"}]},{"label":["Total experience"],"points":[{"start":4814,"end":4883,"text":"Artifacia Hackathon Winner ​— ​Winner at Artifacia AI Hackathon - 2017"}]},{"label":["Total experience"],"points":[{"start":3977,"end":4047,"text":"Driver Trips ​— ​Panel to deal with driver trips and automated payments"}]},{"label":["Total experience"],"points":[{"start":2854,"end":2933,"text":"One of the best Animation Studios in India.
